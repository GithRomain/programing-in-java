    3) this is th call the following attributs in a classe
        super is to call a parent method

    4)inheritence is to hierarchise classes, a parent class can share methods and attributs
    with the children ones

    5) Polymorphisme is to modifie the comportement of the daughter class during on inheritence
    exstends / implements / abstract

    6) the difference is that in a sub-type polymorphisme (example abstract) you can't instantiate
    an attributs

    1)
    - static variable is variable which are not attributs of a class and they are not unique of a class

    - static constant is the same as variable but it cannot be change

    - static method work in any classes even is the object is not

    2) because we want to use it in any classes

    3) because
